        <h1>Not your typical mom blogger... okay maybe I am</h1>
        <p>I’m Kathy.</p>

<p>A sarcastic mother of three (ages 7, 10, and 11) with a busy home daycare that clashes with my desire to do nothing all day.</p>

<p>I’m a has-been English teacher who secretly enjoys fragmented sentences.</p>

<p>My rebellious side.</p>

<p>I love making videos, riding horses, rescuing animals (whether they like it or not),  cooking with my kids, and making people laugh.</p>

<p>I go by Mama Kat, because I’m a mama and I’m Kat and it just felt right putting the two together.</p>

<p>I started blogging privately in August of 2007 as a way to share pictures and stories with family. When they didn’t care I made my blog public and officially fell in love with this online world.</p>

<p>I love that it gives me purpose.</p>

<p>I love that it gives me friends.</p>

<p>And I love that it gives my kids an account of their childhoods so they can look back and see just how and when Mama lost it all.</p>
