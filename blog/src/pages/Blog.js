        <p>I accidentally forgot our dog outside for a few hours. Our dogs are strictly indoor so I’m sure she spent some time scratching at the door to get let back in after her potty break. Unfortunately, I left the house entirely to take the girls to volleyball practice. I was surprised to find that she was sitting on our front porch when we returned. She only has access to the backyard so somehow she managed to dig a hole and escape.</p>

        <p>She was muddy and cold and I gave her a bath. Little did I know that a spark of freedom was lit within that fluffy little head of hers. Now that she had a taste of what life might be like outside of the backyard, she would attempt to dig her way out every chance she got.</p>

        <p>A few days ago I was working on my computer and was pinged via email that someone in the Nextdoor App that I have had reportedly found a lost dog. She was asking all of the neighbors for help identifying it:</p>

        <p>“Sandy???”</p>

        <p>“Sandy!?”</p>

        <p>“SANDY???”</p>

        <p>Suddenly I couldn’t recall if I had let her out or more importantly…back in. After a quick search of the house I realized she most certainly was not inside, which meant the dog in question was, in fact, MY DOG.</p>

        <p>I quickly responded that she was mine and the gal who “rescued” Sandy returned her within the hour. I was definitely surprised to find the dog that I thought was sleeping nearby was actually gallivanting around the neighborhood, she has no loyalty. I have no doubt that if the woman had not looked for Sandy’s home and instead decided to keep her, Sandy would not have given us another thought. If you are kind to her and give her treats, you are her new family.</p>
