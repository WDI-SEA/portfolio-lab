                Lorem Ipsum's father was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald's being, you know, shot.
                I think the only difference between me and the other placeholder text is that I’m more
                honest and my words are more beautiful. Lorem Ipsum is FAKE TEXT!
                My text is long and beautiful, as, it has been well documented, are various other parts of my website. I
                know words. I have the best words.

                I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that wrote Lorem Ipsum, but I don't know, maybe it was. It could
                be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be some wordsmith sitting on their bed that weights 400 pounds. Ok? I was going to say something extremely rough to Lorem Ipsum, to its family, and I said to myself, "I can't do it. I just can't do it. It's inappropriate. It's not nice." I know words. I have the best words. You know, it really doesn’t matter what you write as long as you’ve got a young, and beautiful, piece of text. Lorem Ipsum is the single greatest threat. We are not - we are not keeping up with other websites.
                My placeholder text, I think, is going to end up being very good with women. You could see there was text
                coming out of her eyes, text coming out of her wherever.
                That other text? Sadly, it’s no longer a 10. I think the only difference between me and the other placeholder
                text is that I’m more honest and my words are more beautiful. My placeholder text, I think, is going to end 
                up being very good with women.
