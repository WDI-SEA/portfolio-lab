            <h3>How I got here...</h3>
            <p>I started my adventure into web development way back in 2004. In my junior year of high school I attended college accredited web design courses at an off-site careers center. From there I participated in a web design competition at a local community college and won first prize and earned a year of free tuition! It was nothing special, I merely designed a basic website in notepad :) From there I transferred to DePaul University and graduated with a BS in Management Information Systems. My entire life I'd been active in the music industry and decided after college that this was my time to really dive into my passion. I eventually found myself as the GM of a mid-sized music venue and freelanced as management staff for music festivals. In March of 2020 I decided to go full time into festivals, managing their stages and consulting. When the pandemic hit, the music industry came to a halt. I had always planned on returning to web dev at some point, and this was my time. Enrolling at General Assembly was the best way I could possibly spend my quarantine time!</p>
