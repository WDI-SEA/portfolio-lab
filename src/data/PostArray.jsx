        To scorn that vengeance, which a foe has taught?
        What sure destruction frantick rage can throw,
        The gaping wounds of slaughter’d Pentheus show.
        Why should not Ino, fir’d with madness, stray,
        Like her mad sisters her own kindred slay?
        Why, she not follow, where they lead the way?`

        Can make a Heav'n of Hell, a Hell of Heav'n.
        What matter where, if I be still the same,
        And what I should be, all but less then he
        Whom Thunder hath made greater? Here at least
        We shall be free; th' Almighty hath not built
        Here for his envy, will not drive us hence:
        Here we may reign secure, and in my choyce
        To reign is worth ambition though in Hell:
        Better to reign in Hell, then serve in Heav'n.`
