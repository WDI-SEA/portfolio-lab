                <p>My primary background is in music composition and audio production. After years of working with various sound and video editing programs, I recently decided to try my hand at video game development, as I figure much of my skillset is transferrable.</p>
                <p>I currently work as a one-man dev team, doing all the programming, asset design, sound design, level design, and character animations myself. It is exhausting work, but fun!</p>
                <p>A concept I like to explore in my games is the relationship between the player and the character they control, as well as the nature of escapism itself. A recurring theme in my games is self-awareness: many of my game's characters know or suspect that they are characters in a video game, and revere the player as a sort of demi-god. By giving the characters self-awareness, I feel that the player must make a conscious effort to become invested in the plot, rather than just going along with it because...it's just there.</p>
